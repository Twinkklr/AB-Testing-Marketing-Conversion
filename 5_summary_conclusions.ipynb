Due to the low exposure rate, factors leading to exposure were examined in addition to factors leading to conversion.\n","\n","### Data Source\n","\n","*  Dataset: [Uplift Modeling Dataset by Arashnic on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/uplift-modeling)\n","*  Creator: The Criteo AI Lab\n","*  Description: Contains user behavioral data with treatment/control flags and response labels.\n","*  License: CC0: Public Domain"],"metadata":{"id":"_mtXJ6rnaVCA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 5.1 Objectives Recap\n","\n","This project is focused on determining if the marketing campaign was effective, and also to look at factors that influence successful conversion to identify potential measures to make future campaigns increasingly effective\n","\n","The goals of this analysis are as follows:\n","\n","*  Was the campaign effective at converting users (A/B Testing)?\n","*  If the campaign was successful, how successful was it?\n","*  What factors influence conversion?\n","*  How can the findings be used in future campaigns to increase conversion?\n","\n","In addition, due to the low exposure rates for users who were designated for treatment, and the success of conversion when users were exposed, conversion itself was determined to be a factor that influenced conversion.

Each user was assigned 12 factors; these factors were labeled, \"f0\" through \"f11\", and the values were randomly projected by the authors to ensure confidentiality.\n","\n","Of the large amount of users, over 80% were designated to receive treatment. During the two week campaign, ~653,000 visited the website. ~573,000 users from that group were assigned treatment, and of that group, ~176,500 were exposed.\n","\n","The factors were were examined, and it was noted that there were four potential \"pairs\", where one was a potential transformation of the other.  The pairs were f5 and f7, f4 and f10, f6 and f0, and f8 and f2, with the former being the transform of the latter."],"metadata":{"id":"mlufXj_wfyoT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 5.3 Key Findings\n","\n","#### 5.3.1 EDA\n","\n","The EDA analysis examined the density distributions of each factor for exposure vs. non-exposure for the users that were designated for treatment.  The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine if the distributions were different.  Results indicated that f3, f6, and f0 showed the greatest difference in distribution at 48%, 46%, and 34% respectivly.  f3 and f6 showed correlation of 0.76, while, as noted above, f6 appeared to be a transform of f0.\n","\n","The same was completed for the exposued users who converted, and those who did not.  f4, f10, and f11 were found to have the greatest difference at 46%, 46%, and 39% respectivly.  f4 appeared to be a transform of f10, and f4 had a large, negative correlation with f11 of -0.76.\n","\n","#### 5.3.2 A/B Testing\n","\n","A/B testing was completed, examining conversion rates for users that were and were not exposed to treatment.  The results showed that there was 100% probability that the treatment resulted in users being 2.5 times more likely to convert.\n","\n","#### 5.3.3 Influencing factors for Exposure and Conversion\n","\n","For each analysis, three different machine learning models were used:  Regression, Light Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network.  F1 scores of the positive class were optimized, and SHAP summaries were completed.\n","\n","All 3 models indicated that f6, f3 and f8 had the greatest contribution to users being exposed, with f6 and f3 having an inverse relationship, while f8 had a positive relationship.\n","\n","The conversion model showed the greatest impact from f4, which was significantly larger than the other factors, in a positive relationship.  For the regression and neural network models, the second largest contribution was f11 in an inverse relationship.  For the light gradient boosting method, f6 was the second greatest contributer in an inverse relation.  f6 was the third greatest contributer in the regression model.\n","\n","This paradox indicates that there is a possibility of the factor that encouraged exposure of users was also a reason they may not have converted."],"metadata":{"id":"J3A34kZBf2G2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 5.4 Conclusions\n","\n","This study examined the results of a two week marketing campaign for a website, examining how 12 different factors influenced user conversion.  Overall, the campaign was successful, increasing conversion by 250% when users were exposed to treatment.\n","\n","f6, f3, and f8 had the greatest contribution on exposure, while f4 was a major contributer to conversion, followed by f11 and f6, in a much smaller capacity."],"metadata":{"id":"pGB_E2QhgCXQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 5.5 Recommendations\n","\n","As f4 had the greatest impact on conversion, maximizing it (if possible) has the potential to increase conversion.  f11 had an inverse relationship with conversion, indicating that minimizing it could potentially increase conversion.\n","\n","Due to only ~30% of users who were designated for treatment were actually exposed, there is a potential to increase conversion by increasing exposure.  The factors that had the greatest influence on exposure were f3, f6, and f8.\n","\n","f6 had a negative correlation with exposure, and a positive one with conversion.  Due to this paradox, in order to increase exposure, increasing f8 could potentially increase exposure.  f3 and f6 are highly correlated, so influencing f3 to increase exposure should be done with caution."],"metadata":{"id":"iyGlF6tngJyV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 5.6 Limitations\n","\n","The greatest limitation of this study was not knowing what the factors represented.  Although we can observe factors that influenced exposure and conversion, we are unable to make specific recommendations on how they may be influenced to increase conversion, or if there are groups that have more potential than others that should be targeted.  In a real-world scenario, further recommendations could be made."],"metadata":{"id":"tt-BOAnqgKFz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 5.7 Next Steps\n","\n","Determine what each factor is, and use that knowledge to understand site user behaviours and demographics.  Ensure groups that have potential for conversion are exposed.  Use the findings, potentially influencing high contributing factors to increase the overall number of converted users."],"metadata":{"id":"nGbAg5iigOaK"}}]}
